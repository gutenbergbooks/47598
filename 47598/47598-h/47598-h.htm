<h1 class='nobreak' id='ch1'>AT THE LOST-AND-FOUND DESK</h1>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, that’s my bag. I left it at the lace counter.
Thank you. Please give it to me.
What? I must prove property? Why,
don’t you see it’s mine? That twisty silver monogram
on the side is really E. C. S. That’s my name,
Ella C. Saunders. I told Jim I thought the letters
were too wiggly to be easily read, but I never
thought anybody’d want to read it but me. Describe
contents? Why, of course I can describe the
contents! In one pocket is a sample of lace, just
Platte Val, you know, not an expensive lace, and
with it—I think it’s with it—is a sample of rose-colored
crêpe de Chine—that is, not exactly rose-colored—sort
of crushed plummish or burnt magenta—but
no—come to think, I left those samples with
my dressmaker. Well, anyway, there’s a Subway
ticket—or let me see, did I use that coming down?
I believe I did! Well, there’s a little memorandum
card that slips in—the celluloid sort, you know. No,
there’s nothing written on it. I don’t use it because,
though they pretend you can wash them like a slate,
you can’t. They just smudge. What do you mean
by saying I haven’t told a definite thing yet? I’ve
told you lots! Well, there’s some money—I don’t
know how much; some chicken feed, as Jim calls it—and
a five-dollar bill, I think—oh no—I paid that to
the butcher. Well, there must be a one-dollar bill—two,
maybe. Oh, and there’s a little pencil, a goldy-looking
one; it came with the bag. And some powder-papers—those
leaves, you know; but I believe
I did use the last one yesterday at the matinée. Oh,
dear, how fussy you are! I tell you it’s my bag; I
recognize it myself. Can’t I tell you of some personal
belongings in it so you’ll be sure? Why, yes,
of course I can. My visiting-card, Mrs. James L.
Saunders, is in that small inside pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t I tell you that in the first place?
Why, you rattled me so; and besides, I thought I
had to tell of my own little individual properties,
like samples and tickets and things. Anybody might
have her visiting-card in her bag!”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch2'>TOOTIE AT THE BANK</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how do you do? Are you the Paying Teller?
Well,—that is,—could I please see somebody
else? You see, I’ve just opened an account, and I
want to get some of my money out. There’s the
loveliest hat in Featherton’s window, marked down
to—but, that’s just it! If I get my money from a
Professional Teller, he’ll tell all about my private
affairs, and how much I pay for my hats, and everything!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, Miss. We are called Tellers because
we never tell anything about our depositors’ affairs.
We’re not allowed to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how lovely! Well, then,—if you won’t tell—I’ve
never drawn a check before, and I don’t know
how! Will you help me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly; but I must ask you to make haste.
Have you a check-book?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How curt you are! I thought you’d like to help
me. Men ‘most always do. Yes, I have a check-book,—that
other clerk gave it to me. But I don’t
like it, and I want to exchange it. See,—it has a
horrid, plain black muslin cover! Don’t you have
any bound in gray suède, with gilt edges. I’m willing
to pay extra.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have no other kind, Miss. How much money
do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I don’t know. You see, Daddy put a thousand
dollars in this bank for me. I suppose I may
as well take it all at once. What do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think probably your father meant for you to
take only a part of it at a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I think so, too. He said it would teach me
business habits. He chose this bank because you
have a special department for ladies. But if this
is it, I don’t think much of it. To be sure the plate
glass and mahogany are all right,—but it looks like
‘put up complete for $74.99.’ Don’t you think Mission
furniture and Chintz would be cozier? Yes,
yes, I’ll draw my check! Do give me a moment to
draw my breath first. You see I’m not used to these
things. Why, with a real bank account of my own,
I feel like an Organized Charity! I suppose I ought
to hunt up some Worthy Poor! Well, I’ll just get
that hat first. Now, let me see. Oh, yes, of course
you may help me, but I want to do the actual drawing
myself. It’s the only way to learn. Why, when
I took Art lessons, I made a burnt-wood sofa pillow
all myself! The teacher just stood and looked at
me. He said I had Fate-sealing eyes. Why, you’re
looking at my eyes just the way he did! You seem
so rattled,—why do you? Don’t you know how to
draw a check, either?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, indeed; I have drawn millions of
checks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Millions of checks! How exciting! What do
you do with all your money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t my money, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you ashamed to be drawing millions and
billions of other people’s money! I have a friend
who is engaged to a bank president who got caught
drawing checks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, but how much money do you want to
draw?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much is it customary for ladies to draw?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that depends upon how much they need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I see. People in need draw more than those
in comfortable circumstances, I suppose. I am not
exactly what would be called ‘a needy person.’
Since I left school, of course, I have my own allowance.
Do you approve of girls being put on an allowance,
or do you think it is nicer for them to have
accounts with the trades-people, and not be treated
like children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think that would depend. Would a
check for $100.00 be enough for to-day? What did
you have in mind to use it for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are very impertinent. I am surprised
that people in banks are allowed to ask such questions.
Why should you concern yourself with how
much money I want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was endeavoring to help you about your check.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, certainly. How could you possibly
draw checks if you didn’t know how much the
checks were to be! I like checks much better than
stripes or plaids. Lucille is making me a beautiful
walking suit that is the loveliest imported check that
you ever saw. And checks are nice for men, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it for the hat or for the suit that you want
to draw a check?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course, it is for the hat at Featherton’s
that I want the check. I am afraid you will think
I am silly, but really I have so many things to
think about that it is hard to keep my mind on just
one thing. You must make allowances for girls who
have so many things to think about. Of course,
with a man like you, who only has checks and money
to think about all day long, it is so easy—I’d be
bored if I had nothing but money and checks all day.
I should think it would be diverting to have somebody
call and talk about something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is. Come, now, let us make out this check.
You must write the number first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, isn’t it exciting! Now, wait, let me do it.
You just watch out that it’s all right. But are you
sure you know how yourself? I’d rather have an
Expert to teach me. You know, nowadays, skilled
labor counts in everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I assure you I’m competent in this matter, but I
must beg you to make haste. Write the number in
this blank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What number?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Number one, of course. It’s your first check.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! I knew you were ready to tell everything!
Suppose it is my first check, I don’t want
everybody to know it. Can’t I begin with a larger
number, and then go right on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, I suppose you can, if you like. Begin
with 100.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. I guess I’ll begin with 4887.
I can make lovely 7’s. Don’t you think 4887 is a
pretty number?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very pretty, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now <span class='bold'><span class='it'>you’re</span></span> wasting time. There, I’ve written
the number. What next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The date, please. And the year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve written the date, but it spilled all over
the year space. It doesn’t matter, though, ’cause it’ll
be this year for a long while yet, and this check will
be vouched, or whatever you call it, before the year
is out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must write the year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can I, when there isn’t room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tear that up, and begin a new check.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And waste all that money! Oh, I didn’t want
an account, anyway! I told Daddy it would make
me more extravagant! And you’re so cross to me.
And here, I’ve spoiled a lot of my money the first
thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, Miss Young, you haven’t! There, there,
don’t look so distressed! I’ll make it all right for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll make it all right! How dare you, sir?
Do you dream for a moment I’d take your money
to replace my own losses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, wait, you don’t understand. This check is
worthless until it’s signed. Now, we’ll tear it out,
so, and begin again. Make smaller letters and figures,
can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how cute that check comes out! You just
tear it by the little perforated dots, don’t you? Let
me tear one out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Write it first; you’ll probably spoil it, and have
to tear it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How unkind you are! And I’m doing my very
best. Don’t find fault with me,—please, don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t wrinkle up your nose like that,—it
looks like a crumpled rose petal! And don’t write
your name there! That’s the place for the amount!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a fuss! What does it matter, so long
as all the spaces are filled? My goodness, the check’s
all done, isn’t it? And it’s quite entirely all right,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s irreproachable. How will you have the
money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I take the money, do I have to give you this
check?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I won’t take any money, thank you. I
want to take this check home and show it to Daddy.
He’ll be so pleased and proud! I know he’ll keep it
as a souvenir, and then he’ll give me some of his
money for the hat!”</p>

<h1 id='ch3'>THE DRESSMAKER IN THE HOUSE</h1>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>SCENE.</span>—A sewing-room, with the usual piles of
unfinished or unmended clothing heaped on tables
and chairs. Mrs. Lester, a pretty, fussy little
woman, is trying on her own gowns and then tossing
them aside, one after another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enter Miss Cotton, a visiting dressmaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lester: Oh, Miss Cotton, I’m so glad you’ve
come! I’m nearly frantic. Excuse the looks of this
sewing-room. I don’t see why a sewing-room never
can keep itself cleared up! I suppose it’s because
they never have any closets in them; or if they do,
you have to hang your best dresses there—there’s no
other place. And so this room gets simply jammed
with white work and mending and hats, and I don’t
know what all! My husband says it’s like the Roman
Forum done in dry-goods. But he’s a regular
Miss Nancy about neatness and order. Now, to-day,
Miss Cotton, we’re going to do sleeves. See?
Sleeves! And nothing else. I’m simply driven crazy
by them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, don’t look as if you didn’t know what I
meant! You know, all my gowns have elbow
sleeves, and I must either have long ones put in or
throw the whole dress away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, I know I said I’d wear the short sleeves, if
other people did insist on having long ones. I know
I said I’d be independent, and at least wear out the
ones I have. But I’m conquered! I admit it! It
isn’t any fun to go to a luncheon and be the only
woman at the table with elbow sleeves!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday I went to Mrs. Ritchie’s Bridge, and
my partner, that big Mrs. Van Winkle, with
chains of scarabs all over her chest till she
looked like the British Museum, kept pulling
her long sleeves down farther over her knuckles
just to annoy me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, I know it, my forearm is white and round,
but I declare it makes me feel positively indecent to
go with it bared nowadays. If those suffrage people
would only get for women the right to bare arms,
they’d do something worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, indeed, I can’t afford to get new gowns.
These are too good to throw away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, they may not be the latest style, but I don’t
want those bolster-slip arrangements for mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Van Bumpus, now—you know her, don’t
you? Well, it would take two kimonos to go round
her, I’m sure; and I saw her the other day in one
of those clinging satin rigs. My! she looked exactly
like a gypsy-wagon, the kind that has canvas
stretched over its ribs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, it’s sleeves, sleeves, I’m after to-day—and
that’s why I sent for you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’m going to superintend them, you understand,
but I want you to help, and to do the plain sewing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, to begin on this mauve crépon. I want to
wear it this afternoon, and I think we can easily get
it done, between us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’ve bought a paper pattern—I bought three—for
I mean to spare no expense in getting my sleeves
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I bought three different makes, and think this
one is best. It was a sort of bargain, too, for they
sold the sleeve pattern and a pattern for little boys’
pajamas, all for ten cents. I don’t know what to do
with the pajamas pattern—so that does seem a
waste. I’ve no little boy, and I shouldn’t make pajamas
for him if I had. I think the one-piece
nighties far more sensible. If you know of any one
who has a little boy, I’ll sell that pattern for half
price. Still, ten cents wasn’t much to pay for this
sleeve pattern. You see, it’s really three sleeve patterns.
One plain, with dart; one plain, without dart;
and one tucked. I’ll use them all, in different waists,
but for this mauve crépon, I think, we’ll try the
tucked one. It would be sweet in net or chiffon.
Yes, I bought both materials, for I didn’t know
which you’d think prettier; I trust a great deal to
your judgment and experience, though I always rely
on my own taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, here’s the tucked sleeve. Merciful powers!
Look at the length of it! Oh, it’s to be tucked all
the way up, you see, and that brings it the right
length. Wouldn’t it be easier to cut the sleeve from
net already tucked? No, that’s so—I couldn’t match
the shade in tucked stuff of any sort. I tried in
seven shops. Well, let’s see. These rows of perforations
match these rows. No—that isn’t right.
That would make the tucks wider than the spaces.
Why, I never saw such millions of perforations in
one piece of paper before! Look here, this isn’t a
sleeve pattern at all! It’s a Pianola roll! I’m going
to put through and see if it isn’t that old thing
in F, or something classic. Cut out the tucked
sleeve, Miss Cotton. Oh, wait, I didn’t mean that
literally! My husband reproves me so often for using
slang. I mean, I won’t have my arms done up
in Bach’s fugues; I should feel like a hand-organ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let’s try this plain sleeve with dart. H’m—“lay
the line of large perforations lengthwise of the material.”
And here are large perforations sprinkled
all over the thing! Oh, no, that isn’t the way! Yes,
I’m quite willing you should show me, if you know
yourself—but I see these directions confuse you as
much as they do me; and if there’s to be a mistake
made in cutting this expensive material, I’d rather
make it myself. This says, “developed in piqué it
will produce satisfactory results.” Well, I can’t
wear piqué sleeves in a crépon gown! Can I? There—I’ve
cut it! Now, “close seam, gather between
double crosses, make no seam where there are three
crosses, bring together corresponding lines of perforations—and
finish free edges!” Well! I rather
guess those free edges will finish me! However,
baste it up, Miss Cotton, and I’ll try it on. It’s easy
to make sleeves, after all, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why! I can’t begin to get my arm into that pipe-stem!
What? I should have allowed seams? Why
didn’t you tell me? Oh, no, I didn’t scorn your advice!
Why, that’s what I have you here for! Well,
those sleeves are ruined. A living skeleton couldn’t
get into those. It’s most confusing, the way some
patterns allow seams and some don’t. I was going
to get one with “all seams allowed,” but it had another
part to it—a “brassière.” I don’t know what
that is, but probably some sort of a brass pot or
other bric-à-brac junk, and I don’t want any more
of that. The den is full now. Well, I’m tired of
making sleeves. What do you think, Miss Cotton,
of just adding lace lower halfs? I bought a lovely
pair, in case the sleeves didn’t turn out well. Now,
I’ll put on the bodice, and you pin them on, and we’ll
see how they look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, they’re not nearly long enough! They ought
to come well below my wrists. And such beautiful
lace—it’s a shame not to use them. Yes, perhaps a
band of lace at the elbow might help. No, that looks
awfully patchy—take it away. A ruching at the
wrist? No, nobody wears that. Oh, dear, what can
we do? I must have this gown for this afternoon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here’s a pair of long lace sleeves, whole ones, I
bought in case I needed them. Would they do? No—the
lace doesn’t match that on the bodice. Dye
them? No, thank you! I bought some dye once,
and the package said on the outside in big letters:
“Dyeing at Home! No trouble at all!” and it gave
me such a turn, I never could think of wearing a
dyed sleeve! What can I do? I believe I’ll wear
them as they are. I hate long sleeves anyway. They
get so soiled, and they bag at the elbows, and they’re
terribly unbecoming. Oh, I’ve a whole black net
guimpe! I bought it, thinking it might be useful for
something. Suppose we rip out these sleeves, and
the lace neck, and just wear the bodice over this
guimpe!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! oh! it looks horrid! just like an old-fashioned
“jumper” suit! You’ll have to put the neck back
as it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But then what can we do with the sleeves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing! Just nothing! I shall have to stay at
home until I can get some entirely new gowns made.
It’s a sin and shame, the way we poor women have
to be slaves to Fashion! And I know, just as soon
as I am fitted out with long sleeves, the pretty, short
ones will come in style again!</p>

<h1 id='ch4'>THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS</h1>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>SCENE.</span>—The Pelhams’ living room. It is decorated
for Christmas, and on tables are displayed
many beautiful gifts that have been sent to
Mr. and Mrs. Pelham.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pelham (in pretty evening gown and a spray
of holly in her hair, looks wistful and discontented.
She stands by a table and fingers some of the gifts,
and then sits at the piano and hums a snatch of
a Christmas carol, and then throws herself into an
easy chair. She speaks): Dick, do stop reading
the paper, and be Christmassy! It might as well be
the eighteenth of July as the twenty-fourth of December,
for all the Christmas spirit you show! I do
think this is the pokiest old Christmas Eve I ever
spent, and I thought it was going to be the loveliest!
I thought for once I’d have everything ready ahead
of time—and now look at the result! Nothing to do,
nothing to enjoy, no surprises. Everybody said,
“Let’s buy our gifts early, and so save the poor
shopgirls’ lives.” And goodness knows I’m only too
glad to help the poor shopgirls in any way I can!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why, I never wait for my change,—if it’s only
a few pennies,—and you’d be surprised to see how
pleased and surprised they are at that. It’s pathetic
to see their gratitude for six cents. Why, the other
day Mrs. Muchmore kept me waiting with her a
long time to get her nine cents change, and when I
suggested that she come away without it, and let
the shopgirl have it, she looked at me as if I had
robbed her. Well, then we were late for the matinée,
and had to take a taxicab; so she didn’t make
much, after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No; I’m a great friend of the shopgirl, and I’m
glad to do all I can for them; but this buying Christmas
presents in October is so tame and uninteresting!
Then I bought all my tissue paper and holly
ribbon and fancy seals in November; and early in
December I had the whole lot tied up and labeled. I
had three clothes-baskets full of the loveliest looking
parcels! And then they sat around till I was sick
of the sight of them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don’t you remember, Dick, how you used to tumble
over them in the guest rooms? And you said I
was a dear, forehanded little wife to have them all
ready so soon? You’ll never have such a forehanded
little wife again, I can tell you!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, to save the poor expressman, everybody
is urged to send their presents early nowadays. So
I sent mine all off a week ago. And everybody sent
theirs to me a week ago. To be sure, this plan has
the advantage that often I can see what someone
else sends me, before I send a return gift. My! it
was lucky I saw Bertha Hamilton’s Armenian centerpiece
before I sent her that veil case! I changed,
and sent her an Empire mirror, and she’ll think her
centerpiece rather skinny now!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, all the same, I hate this fashion. Why, I’ve
had all this junk set out on tables four days now,
and I’m tired of the sight of it. And even the
p-p-paper and st-string are all cleared away. No—Dick—I’m
not crying, and you needn’t try to coax
me up! Well, of course, it isn’t your fault, though
you did egg me on. But everybody does it now, and
we’ve even written our notes of thanks to each
other. I always used to dread doing those the day
after Christmas; but now it makes me homesick to
think they’re all d-done. And even this lovely necklace
you gave me I’ve had it a w-week, and it doesn’t
seem like a Christmas present at all! Yes, I know
I gave you your gold cigarette case two weeks ago;
but I wanted to be sure you liked it before I had it
monogrammed. It seems now as if I had given it
to you last year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, I think it used to be lovely when we didn’t
get our things until Christmas Eve or Christmas
Day—and then some belated presents would come
straggling along for days afterward! And the night
before Christmas we were madly rushing around tying
up things, and I’d be up till all hours finishing
a piece of embroidery, and you’d have to tear downtown
for some forgotten presents, and the bundles
were simply piling in, and the expressman would
come at midnight, grumbling a little, but very merry
and Christmassy! Then I’d have to set the alarm,
and get up at five o’clock Christmas morning to
press off my centerpiece, and pack off Clara’s box,
and do a thousand things before breakfast. And
we’d eat breakfast by snatches between undoing parcels
and sending off boxes. And the rooms were
knee-deep with a clutter of paper and strings and excelsior
and shredded tissue, and—oh, it was lovely!
And now—all that has been over for a week! And
it really didn’t happen then; for it’s all been gradual
since October. And here it is Christmas Eve, and
not a thing to do! And to-morrow morning it’ll be
Christmas, and not a thing to do! Oh, Dick, it’s
perfectly horrid, and I’ll never, never get ready for
Christmas early again! I’m so lonesome for the
hurry and rush of an old-fashioned Christmas Eve!</p>

<p class='pindent'>What’s that? You’ll take me downtown—now?
Down to the shops? ’Deed I will get my coat and
hat! There isn’t a soul left to buy a present for;
but we can buy some things for next year—Oh, no,
no, not that! But we’ll buy some things and give
them to the shopgirls. And, at any rate, we’ll get
into the bustle and cheer of a real Christmas Eve!
Come on, Dick, I’m all ready! Merry Christmas,
Dick!</p>

<h1 id='ch5'>A NEW RECRUIT</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, good morning, Miss Coggswell! Do
sit down. Yes, isn’t it? So spring-like and
balmy. Oh, not at all; I’m never busy. I’m always
glad to see callers. On business? Oh, I don’t know
anything about business! About Suffrage! Why,
you look so lady-like! Become a Suffragist? Me?
Oh, I’m happily married! Oh, excuse me! I don’t
mean but what you are far happier unmarried—of
course you are, or you wouldn’t have stayed so. But—well,
really, I don’t know the first principles of
this suffrage business. Not necessary? Oh, I think I
ought to know what I’m joining; and, besides, the
suffrage people are such frumps. What! They’re
going to dress better? Well, I’m glad of it. But,
really, you know, I’m not a bit suffragy. Why, I’m
afraid of a mouse, and I just love lingerie ribbons!
And, anyway, I should vote just as Bob told me to,
and I’m sure everyone else would, so it would just
double the men’s votes, you see. The unmarried
women? Yes, that’s so; I’d forgotten them. But I
suppose they’d ask their brothers-in-law or their
ministers or somebody, for you certainly can’t tell
how to vote by reading the papers!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s all in the future, and you only want me
to help the cause? What! as an ornament? Oh,
Miss Coggswell! Why, I don’t know? Who? Oh,
Mrs. Hemingway-Curtis! And Mrs. Vanderheyden-Wellsbacher!
Oh, why they wear lovely clothes!
They’re the kind of people that might be called
‘classy.’ I never use that word, but somehow it
seems to fit them. They want notoriety, the same
as the people in the country papers who have their
back fence painted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you want me to write papers? Oh, yes, I
could do that. I belong to the Pallas At Home Circle.
You just tell the government how to make the
laws, and you purify politics, and things like that.
That part is easy enough. Of course I’ve kept up
with the suffrage movement; one must be intelligent.
I know all about how they want the shirtwaist
makers not to make so many waists, and I
don’t wonder! I don’t wear them any more, anyway;
nobody does.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And vivisection? Oh, yes, I read a lot about
that. They want poor, dumb animals to have a vote.
Oh, I understand those things well enough, but I’m
really too busy to do much about them. Oh, you
only want me to lend my name. Yes, I do want
honest politics; but I think they’re too honest as it
is. They won’t let you smuggle in a little bit of lace
or anything like that, as we used to do. I don’t
mind paying the customs, but it’s so much more fun
to smuggle! As if two or three little bits of lace
would hurt the United States government!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Equal rights? Have half of Bob’s money? Oh,
I have more than that now! What! Some women
don’t? Well, if they don’t know how to get it, they
don’t deserve to have it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, then, you see, I’m such a home-body, and
I’m perfectly daffy over my children! You should
see Bobbins since he had his curls cut off! Broke
my heart; but such a duck of a mannie! And Gwen
is the dearest baby! Just think! Yesterday she was
eating her bread and jam, and she said—Oh, well,
of course, if you haven’t time to listen—Yes, I see,—business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,—Oh, I never could speak in public! Oh,
just sit on the stage and wear lovely gowns? Yes,
I’d rather like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose I might be persuaded to become
a suffragist; but I think I’d rather have an aeroplane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do believe in independence. I think every
woman ought to have a mind of her own and decide
upon her own actions. I hate a wobbly-minded
woman! Well, about this suffrage business, I’ll ask
my husband and do as he says.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch6'>SHOPPING FOR POSTAGE STAMPS</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“You keep stamps, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss; what kind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I don’t know. But I want something that
will go well with blue note paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, miss; do you want letter postage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course! I want to post letters, not chairs or
tables!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the letters to? United States?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful young man, or I’ll report you for rudeness.
I won’t tell you where the letter is going, it’s
private correspondence, but it is in the United
States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you want a two-cent stamp; here you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, red ones! Never! Do you suppose I’d put
that sickly shade of crushed gooseberry juice on my
robin’s egg blue envelopes? Is this the nearest thing
you have in two-cent stamps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The very latest style, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they won’t do. Why, they aren’t fit for
anything, unless to make a stamp plate with.
Haven’t you any blue ones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we have a nice line of blue ones, at five
cents each.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the price doesn’t matter; let me see them,
please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they are, beautiful shade of blue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m; good enough shade, but it doesn’t quite
harmonize with my envelopes. You see they are a
sorty of greenishy-blue, and your stamps are more
indigoish. Do you expect any new ones in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, not any different colors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, that’s always the way! But maybe I
could take some of these and dye them with my
Easter egg dyes, to match my paper. I did that
with some lace, and it worked awfully well! What’s
the lightest color you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These pale green ones are as light as any. But
if you dye them blue you can’t use them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The government won’t allow it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How mean! As if it made any difference to them
what color stationery people use! It almost makes
me want to be a suffragette when I hear of such
tyranny! Not that I’d really be one! I’m too fearfully
afraid of a mouse! But I’d like to have a few
rights about postage stamps. I do think the selection
is very limited. There’s more beauty and variety
in cigar bands. Well, I’ll look at these violet
ones. How much are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are three cents apiece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m, two for five cents, I suppose. Well, I could
get violet note paper, and use violet ink; then these
stamps would do nicely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they’d match your eyes fairly well, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that queer! Everybody says I have violet
eyes, but, really they’re not a bit the color of these
stamps, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Look at me and let me see; well, no,
they’re not exactly the same shade, but they’re violet
eyes, all right. How many stamps will you have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two, please; but won’t you give them to me out
of the middle of the sheet? Those around the edge
seem a little faded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t tear stamps out of the middle of a
sheet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you can, if you try—if I ask you to try!
I’ll take that one, and that one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose it doesn’t matter. This one did
you say? And this one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, please. Will you wrap them up in a neat
parcel, and send them? Good morning.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch7'>AT THE BRIDGE TABLE</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, Mrs. Sevier, I’m going to play at
this table. Where do I sit? Here? Perhaps
you’d rather have this seat, with your back to the
light, don’t you know? Cut for partners? Ace low.
Why, isn’t that funny! I always thought the ace
was the highest card of all, if you don’t use a joker.
And you don’t in Bridge. Do you? No; I haven’t
played very much, but I’m quick at catching on. I
always say Bridge is for those who are too old or too
married to flirt. Oh, I beg your pardon, Mrs. Sevier,
of course you’re not either! Well, I know you’ve
been married twice, but that isn’t much nowadays.
I’m perfectly sure I never shall be married at all. Of
course, I’m only nineteen, but I think I look older.
No? Well, one can’t tell about one’s looks. Mother
says very few sensible men would want to marry
me! But I tell her very few would be enough.
Now, you needn’t laugh at that, Mr. Chapman, it’s
quite true. Are you my partner? No? Oh, I play
with Mr. Ritchie, and you play with Mrs. Sevier.
Very well, let’s begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we play Lilies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play Lilies? Why, Mr. Chapman, I thought we
were to play Bridge! I took half a dozen lessons a
year ago. I haven’t played since, but I’ve a marvelous
memory. Oh, I see, you’re just chaffing me, because
my name is Lilly! You mean you’ll play
Lilly’s game. Now, you’ll excuse me, won’t you, if
I sort my cards face down, on the table? Why, I
seem to have five suits! I declare, my hand is a perfect
rubbish heap! Oh, Mrs. Sevier, have you joined
that new City Beautiful Club? I’m on the Rubbish
Committee, and I have to read a paper on the æsthetic
decoration of ash cans, or Art in Rubbish. It’s
such fun! I love women’s clubs. I’m going to join
another. I forget what it’s called, but they want
poor, dumb animals to have a vote, or something like
that. Well, come on, people, let’s play Bridge. Oh,
don’t look like that, Mr. Ritchie! Gay and festive,
please! Is it my deal? Well, you just deal for me.
I always come out wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are my conventions? Really, I haven’t
any. I’m the most unconventional person you ever
saw. Why, mother says—but speaking of conventions,
our Federated Clubs are going to have a stunning
convention next week. That’s where I’m going
to read my paper. I’ve a screaming new costume—and
a hat! Well, if I began to tell you about that
hat it would interrupt our game. Wait till I’m
Dummy, Mrs. Sevier, and I’ll tell you. I expect
these men wouldn’t really care to—Oh, my discard?
Yes, indeed—I—why, yes, of course I always discard
spades. They count the least, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless they’re lilies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Ritchie! How dear of you! Do you
really set such store by my spades? Now, that’s a
partner worth having! I love to play Bridge, if I
can have my own way. Do you know, of all things,
I hate disapproval. I just can’t stand it if people are
cross to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t even avail yourself of a cross-ruff, do
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Ritchie, how witty! Did I overlook a
chance? That reminds me of a lady in our club,
Mrs. Ruff. You see, she hasn’t a very becoming
husband—at present—and she always looks so discontented,
we call her the Cross Ruff! Yes—yes—I
am going to play. I was just thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heavens and earth, Mrs. Sevier, don’t look
at me like that! Your eyes are perfect sledgehammers!
No, I wasn’t peeking into Mr. Chapman’s
hand! But I just chanced to catch a glimpse of his
Queen of Hearts—Oh, Mr. Chapman, are you going
to the Muchmore’s fancy ball? Because, I’m going
as Queen of Hearts, and if you wanted to go as
King of Hearts—Hal Breston insists he’s going to
take that part, but—well, I want to pique him—Yes,
yes, Mrs. Sevier, I know it’s my play, I was just
thinking. Bridge isn’t a game you can play thoughtlessly—like
Tit-tat-toe. You see, the Dummy is on
my right hand—don’t you think that phrase has a
funny sound? ‘She sat on her hostess’ right hand?’
How could the poor hostess eat? Yes, yes—there,
I’ll play my king. Oh, he’s taken it with the ace!
Why, I thought that was out long ago! Well, you
made me play so fast, I scarcely knew what I was
playing. I’m afraid you’ll think I’m flighty, but
really I have so many things on my mind, it’s hard
to think of only one at a time. Of course, it’s different
with you, Mrs. Sevier. Your life is more in
a rut—if you know what I mean. Well, being married,
you can’t help that. Yes, I know it’s my play—I
was just thinking. I guess I’ll play a diamond.
I know I’m returning my opponent’s lead, but I
have a reason. Now, don’t scold me, Mr. Ritchie;
I simply cannot play if people disapprove of what I
do. Yes, smile at me like that, it’s ever so much
nicer! You seem a little put out, Mrs. Sevier! Are
you holding poor hands? Come, come, if these two
gentlemen and I are having such a pleasant game,
you must enjoy it, too. What did you bid, Mrs.
Sevier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I shall have to bid adieu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, must you go, really? Too bad! Well, good
night, and thank you for such a pleasant time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, let us play three-hand auction; it’s a splendid
game.”</p>

<h1 id='ch8'>SHE GOES SHOPPING</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Mr. Willing, good afternoon! How
pleasant to meet you on the avenue like
this. But what are you doing in the shopping district?
Hunting bargain neckties? There, there,
don’t look so utterly galvanized; I didn’t mean it.
Besides, I know perfectly well why you’re here;
you came on the mere chance of meeting me! Ah,
ha, you needn’t look so embarrassed about it. I don’t
mind being seen with you; I’m not a bit exclusive.
Well, it was a shame to tease him—so it was. Now,
as a very special favor, how would you like to go
into Price’s with me, while I shop a little?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m, you don’t seem awfully eager. What?
Walk up the avenue instead? Well, we will, afterward.
But let’s run in here just a minute while I
buy a veil. It won’t take any time at all. And then
we can go for a walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a crowd! I do think the people get
thicker every year. Well, did you get through? I
thought I’d lost you. When I saw you wedged in
that revolving door with that fat lady you looked so
funny. She was real cross, wasn’t she? But you
were so meek, I had to laugh. You looked like a
feeble-minded jelly fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, Willy Willing, don’t peeve. Smile a
’ittle bitsy; yes, you do seem to be the only man
here. But I’m glad to have you, it is so nice to
have a man to pilot one through a shopping crowd.
Oh, of course, the floor-walkers are just for that purpose,
but they can’t go outside their diocese, or
whatever you call it. Now, you can go ahead and
blaze a trail. The veil counter is over that way, I
think, anyway, it’s quite near the ribbons and catty-cornered
across from the artificial flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, here we are at last. Now, I’ll sit on this
stool and you stand right by me. Don’t let women
push in between us, for I want your advice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, look who’s here! Why, Tottie May! I
haven’t seen you since we were in Venice. Do you
remember Venice? And those two long lines of
Hoffman houses each side of the Grand Canal!
Wasn’t it stunning? You, darling, how lovely to
see you again. Yes, yes, I do, I do want to be waited
on, but do wait a minute, can’t you? Yes, I want
veiling, by the yard—there, that’s the kind I want.
Oh! please don’t let that woman carry it off!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodby, darling, must you go? Yes, the large
meshed kind. Oh, no, not that one covered with little
blue beads. I should feel as if I had turquoise
measles. I want a sort of gray—the shade they call
‘Frightened Mouse’—though why a mouse should
ever be frightened when we are all scared to death
of them—There, Mr. Willing, do you think this one
is becoming? When I hold it up against my face,
so. Where’s baby? Peep-bo. Oh, gracious, that
floor-walker thought I peep-boed at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy me, I have rubbed all the powder off my
nose. Oh, no, it won’t hurt the veil. I beg your
pardon, madame, did I push you with my elbow?
Indeed, I’m not taking up all the room. I’m fearfully
crowded. And I rather fancy I can try the effect
of a veil if I want to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Willy Willing, how do you like this one,
with the big polka dots? Yes, I know, only one dot
shows, they’re so big and so far apart. But polka
dots are so fashionable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the polka is coming in again—the
dance I mean? They call it the panther polka? It’s
awful sinuous—a sort of stealthy glide—makes you
think of Sarah Bernhardt, or Elinor Weeks, but the
best people have taken it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? you’re afraid they’ll get taken up? Oh,
Willie Willing, how witty you are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, do you like this veil? Don’t you think
it suits my hair? Mr. Dow says my hair is a yellow
peril. I don’t know what he means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like my face better without my veil? Why,
how pretty of you. Now, just for that I’ll let you
select one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d select a bridal veil? Oh, fie, fie, Mr. Willing.
You don’t really—Yes, I do want a veil. Please
show me some of your other styles. And Mr. Willing,
what do you think? At Gladys’s wedding next
week, she is going to have—Certainly, my dear girl,
I’m ready to look at your goods, but these are not
the veils I want. Show me something newer, these
are all—Why, Gladys said that Polly Peters said—do
you remember Polly Peters? Well, you’d never
know her now. Slim! She’s nothing but a spine—Yes,
my girl, I’m looking at your veils, but I want
the piece that lady has just picked up. Let’s wait
till she lays it down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Willing, you mustn’t get impatient.
You men don’t realize what hard work shopping is,
until now—Oh, my gracious! I have to be at our
culture class by 4 o’clock. There’s a lecture on ‘Art
Uplift in the Kitchen,’ and I know it will be fine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t cook, but it’s such a satisfaction to
know that one’s soup is made in a Greek-shaped jug,
instead of a crude iron kettle—Oh, mercy, no! I
wouldn’t wear a veil like that! Why, Mrs. Bailey
had one like that once, and the very day I saw her
wearing it I lost my amethyst hatpin. I’ve always
considered a veil like that unlucky ever since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t seem to care for any of these veils,
they’re not a bit distinctive. And a veil is such an
important part of a costume—it dresses up the face
so. These patterns are most uninteresting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Willing Willy, let’s go down to Storer’s
and look at veils there—shall us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you don’t seem to want to go a bit. Now,
don’t go just to please me. I thought perhaps you
were interested in—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you want to go? Do you know I believe
you men just love to go shopping, and you only pretend
you don’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, dear, that your veils don’t suit me,
but, of course, I can’t buy what I don’t want just to
help the store along; you couldn’t expect that, could
you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, anyway, I wasn’t exactly buying a veil—I
was just shopping for one.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch9'>A QUIET AFTERNOON</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Willing? I’m so glad
to see you! I was just saying to myself it’s
such a dull afternoon I’d be glad to see anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you’re just fishing for a compliment, but
you won’t get it. Sit down in that big easy chair
and we’ll have a nice, quiet, comfy afternoon, and
you can talk to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I’ll talk to you, then. I want to ask
your advice about something. I’m in a—well, a
sort of a dilemma—and I want the judgment of a
man of the world—an all-round knowing man—if
you know what I mean. Oh, there’s the telephone—pardon
me, Mr. Willing—I’ll just see who it is—no,
you needn’t leave the room—it’s probably Tottie,
or some of the girls. Hello! Oh, hello! Is that
you, Jack? Why, you dear boy, I’m so glad to see
you—hear you, I mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? Not really? Oh, the idea! Now, don’t
you flatter me like that—oh, no, no—I couldn’t possibly!—well,
maybe—if you’ll promise to be good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, now? Oh, no, Jack, you can’t come up
here now. I’m—just going out! No—you didn’t
hear a man’s voice exclaiming! That was Fido!
Yes, he has a human sort of a bark. Well, yes, it is
a little like Willy Willing’s voice—he’s a perfect
puppy! What! No! Of course, I mean Fido. No,
Jack, you can’t come now; I tell you I’m going out.
I have on my hat and coat already—yes, that was
Fido again—he always makes that queer sound
when anybody telephones. (Puts hand over transmitter.)
Mr. Willing, you must keep still, or I won’t
tell all these fibs for your benefit! But I don’t want
our nice quiet afternoon intruded upon—Yes, Jack,
come to-morrow. I have something I want to consult
you about. I really need the advice of a (covers
transmitter again)—Mr. Willing, please step into
the library for a moment. Look at the new books
on the table—Yes, Jack, truly, I need the experienced
advice of an all-round man of the world—like
you—oh, yes, you are—you’re awfully well balanced
and all that—don’t talk when I am talking—wait
till I ring off—oh, Jane is just bringing me a card—wait
a minute, Jack—why, it’s Mr. Strong—I like
that man awfully well—show him in, Jane. Goodby,
Jack—no, I can’t listen now—good-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Mr. Strong? Do sit down. Take
this easy chair. I’m so glad to see you—yes, isn’t
it dull weather? So good of you to come and
brighten up an otherwise lonely afternoon. Excuse
me, just a moment; there’s a new book in the library
I want to show you. (Goes into next room.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Mr. Willing, you must stay here till Mr.
Strong goes. Because, if you show yourself, you’ll
have to leave here before he does——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, he’ll hear you—now, I won’t be a bit entertaining
to him, and he’ll soon go—and then we
can have our nice, quiet afternoon. Now, will you
be goody-boy and stay here and not make a sound?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I’ll eavesdrop everything you say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care. I shan’t mean a word of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if you don’t fire him pretty swift I’ll come
in there and stir up a hurrah’s nest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! there! there! little one. Rest tranquil!
Read a nice, pretty book or something, but don’t
smoke, or he’ll know somebody’s in here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Lilly returns to drawing room.) “Yes, I’m so
glad you came, Mr. Strong—what book?—Oh, yes,
I was going to show you a book, but I—it wasn’t
there. Never mind, let’s just chat—I want to ask
you something, something serious, you know. May
I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—I don’t know—you see, it’s Leap Year!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Mr. Strong, don’t frivol. It doesn’t suit
your iron-bound countenance. And, truly, I’m in
earnest! You know, we women like to get the ideas
of a man’s brain! A man of judgment and experience—a—well,
what they call a man of the world—oh,
yes, you are. I often quote your opinions—they’re
so profound. Now, what I want to ask you
about is—oh, there’s the telephone—excuse me—just
a tiny minute—no, don’t go. Oh, hello! Is that
you, Flossy? Darling girl, do come over, can’t you?—yes,
now—right away—oh, I wish you could—I
want to hear all about it!—only last night?—a ruby
and diamond!—oh, heavenly!—well, come to-morrow
morning, then—yes—yes, indeed, dearest—goodby—goodby—yes,
I think so, too—perfectly
horrid, but, oh, of course, yes—goodby—no, nothing
of the sort—yes, I’ll come right over—goodby—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, must you go, Mr. Strong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes, I did tell Miss Fay I’d go over to see
her, but I meant after your call was over—please
don’t go yet—you must? Well, come again, do—I
always enjoy a talk with you—you’re so—so profound—if
you know what I mean. Good afternoon,
Mr. Strong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, come back, Mr. Willing! Didn’t I tell you
I’d get rid of him in short order? But he’s such an
everlasting talker it’s hard to make him go. Now,
we can have our nice, quiet afternoon. Excuse me
just a minute first—I want to telephone just the
leastest word to Tottie May!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hello! Is this you, darling? What do you
think?—oh, you know already? Did Flossy tell
you?—oh, no, not really! Well, for gracious goodness’
sake!—yes, coral-pink chiffon, in one of those
new smudge designs—oh, yes—a black chip Gainsborough,
with practically all the feathers in the
world piled on it—no, Thursday afternoon—why,
about five—violets? Well, rather! Oh, Tottie—and,
yes, Mr. Willing is here, but he can’t hear what
you say—no, he doesn’t mind waiting—oh, Tottie!
I can’t believe it. Yes, she did! And she said that
Billy said if she ever did such a thing again—Oh,
Tottie, what do you think? Mr. Willing has gone!”</p>

<h1 id='ch10'>TAKING CARE OF UNCLE</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Uncle Abel! Here’s me! Here’s your
little ray of sunshine. Aunt Hetty sprung
a C. Q. D. at me over the telephone and said she
had to go to a meeting of some Hen’s Club or other,
and would I come around here and sit with you. So
I came just as soon as I could skittle over. You
poor dear, are you awfully tired of staying in the
house? Well, I suppose gout is annoying. Why
don’t you try Mental Science? They say it’s fine!
You know, you just think you haven’t any gout, and
then you don’t have any! Though, for that matter,
you might as well think you hadn’t any foot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, then, wouldn’t I have any?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose not. But that wouldn’t do any
good, because I’ve heard that soldiers, or any people
with their feet cut off, feel them hurting just the
same. But, never mind, my poor darling, I’m going
to be so entertaining this afternoon that you won’t
know whether you have any feet or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Entertaining, hey? I suppose that means you’ll
chatter like a confounded magpie till I’m nearly
crazy. I don’t see why women have to be eternally
talking!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there, Uncle Abel, your foot is bad to-day,
isn’t it? Aunt Hetty said you were as cross
as a teething baby—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she said that, did she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and she said she hoped to goodness I could
chirk you up some, for she’d just about reached the
end of her patience!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! She never had any patience! Now, if
she were in my plight—full of chronic hereditary
gout, and just getting over the grippe—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you ought to be thankful it isn’t chronic
hereditary grippe! But men can’t stand a bit of discomfort!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound your impertinence, Miss! What are
you talking about? I don’t know what your aunt
meant by getting you over here this afternoon!
You’ve no more feeling or sympathy than a Dutch
doll!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes I have, Uncle, dear! Here, I’ll rest your
foot in an easier position—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ooo! E—E! Ouch!! Gosh, Lilly! I wish I
had something to throw at you! Get away, girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so sorry for your poor, dear, suffering
old wrapped-up bundle of foot! Here, let me put
another sofa cushion under it. Say, Uncle, I saw
the loveliest burnt leather sofa-pillow in Van Style’s
window as I came along! It would suit my room
beautifully. There, there, dear, let me rub your forehead
with this cologne; isn’t that soothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soothing nothing! You’ve doused it all in my
eyes, they smart like fire! Oo, ouch! Lilly, get
out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, try that mental science again. Think they
don’t smart. Think you haven’t any eyes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I hadn’t any ears! Do stop chattering,
Lilly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My! Aunt Hetty sized up your state of mind
all right, didn’t she? Well, Uncle, I guess I’ll read
to you. Here’s a lovely story in this new magazine.
Listen: ‘The pale young man fairly trembled
as he looked at her. “Ethelyn,” he murmured, in
sighing tones, “you are so adorably subtle, so tragically
intensive, that I feel—I feel—”’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I refuse to know how that young nincompoop
felt! Shut up that fool book, Lilly! If you must
read, read me some Wall Street news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Uncle Abel, here goes. I’ll read from
this morning’s paper: ‘Coffee declined rather sharply
at the opening.’ Why, how funny! What was
the opening? A sort of a reception day? And if
people declined coffee, why did they do so sharply?
Why not say, ‘No, thank you,’ and take tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want that column; turn to ‘Gossip of
Wall Street.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, here that is. But, Uncle, do the magnates
and things gossip? I thought that was a woman’s
trick! Well, here we are: ‘Steel rail changes discussed
all day!’ Oh, Uncle, and then to call women
chatterboxes! When men talk all day long about a
foolish little thing like changing a steel rail! Why,
I can change a whole hat in less time than that!
Say, Uncle, there was the dearest hat in the Featherton’s
window—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet it was dear if it was in that shop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but it had been reduced; marked down to
$27.99. Such a bargain! Uncle, you know my birthday
comes next week—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, which do you want, the hat or the sofa-pillow
you hinted for a while ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Uncle, how lovely of you! But it’s hard to
choose between them. Suppose I had them both
sent home on approval—and then I can see—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know what that means!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, here comes the maid, with your beef tea.
No, Jane, let me take it; I’ll give it to him. You
may go, Jane. I’ll just taste this, Uncle, to be sure
it isn’t too hot for you. Oh, how good it is! I’ve
often thought I’d like to be an invalid just on account
of the lovely things they get to eat. Why,
this beef tea is delicious! And such a pretty cup
and saucer. Do you know, Ethel Wylie has a whole
set like this. ‘Coalport,’ isn’t it? Say, Uncle, what
do you think about the coal strike? Do tell me
all about it—I’m shockingly ignorant of politics. Do
they call it a strike because the men get mad and
strike each other? Or what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lilly, if you don’t want all that beef tea, I believe
I could relish a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Uncle, how thoughtless of me! I’ve sipped
nearly all of it! I suppose I sort of thought I was
at a tea. But I think there’s as much as you ought
to take. Dear Uncle, it’s so nice to see you eat
something nourishing. I’m sure it will do you good.
It must be awful to have the grippe. And you have
headache, haven’t you? Now, don’t say no—I can
see it in your poor, dear eyes. I’m going to tie this
wet bandage round your forehead—so—oh, no, it
isn’t dripping down your neck—it can’t be. Well,
it will soon stop. Now I’ll rub this menthol on the
bridge of your nose—now, now, Uncle, don’t scowl
like that. If you won’t try mental science we must
use remedies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lilly, if you don’t let me alone I’ll throw this
cup and saucer at you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Uncle, dear, don’t be so peevish! There,
now, I’ll pat your poor foot and sing to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ooch! Oh, the devil! Lilly, get out! There!!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Uncle, you’ve smashed that lovely ‘Coalport!’
Did those gentle little pats hurt your foot?
I don’t believe it! I declare a man is worse to take
care of than a baby! Thank goodness, here comes
Aunt Hetty!”</p>

<h1 id='ch11'>IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE</h1>

<p class='pindent'>I have some material here I wish to exchange—I
say I have—Will you kindly wait on me?—Busy?—I
have some—Now, I must be waited on;
I’m in a great hurry! Oh, very well. I have some
material here I wish to exchange. It’s marquisette,
but it isn’t the right shade. Not marquisette?—Chiffon
marquisine? Well, I don’t care if it’s linsey-woolsey!
I want to exchange it, or rather, return it.
No, I don’t have a charge account; I want the money
back. Please give it to me quickly. I’m going to
a matinée—What! You can’t take it back here? I
must go to the desk? Why, I bought it here, right
at this counter, of that thin girl with the hectic
flush. She doesn’t look well, does she? She ought
to go to some good sanatorium. Well, you see this
chiffon, or whatever it is, is the wrong shade. I
asked for elephant’s breath, and this is more on the
shade of frightened mouse. It doesn’t match my
satin at all.—Oh, dear, how unaccommodating you
are! Well, where is the desk? Ask the floor-walker?
Oh, very well!—Please direct me to the desk.
What desk? I don’t know, I’m sure! Any desk
will suit me. I want to return some goods that
doesn’t match my own material, and you know, this
season, if—Near the rear door?—Of course they’d
put it as far away as possible!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is this the exchange desk? Well, I want to return
this piece of goods—Oh, no! It isn’t soiled!
That’s the original color. Frightened mice often
look soiled when they’re not at all! Yes, that is the
name! No, it isn’t taupe, nor mode, nor steel common,
it’s just frightened mouse. I can carry colors
in my eye just like an artist. Now it doesn’t matter
what color it is, anyway, for it’s the wrong color!—Cut
off the piece? Of course it’s cut off the piece!
There’s two yards and a half of it—Remnant? No,
it was not! I don’t buy leftovers!—Then you can’t
change it? Well, come to think, maybe it was a
remnant! Yes, I believe it was! I don’t often get
them, but this just matched my satin,—I mean it
didn’t match my satin, and that’s why I bought it.
No, I mean—well, anyway, I want to return it.—Had
it a long time? Well, I couldn’t help that!
The dressmaker disappointed me,—that is, I had to
go to some bridge parties and things unexpectedly,
so I had to put her off. But the minute she pinned
it on the pattern I saw it was the wrong shade.
Pinholes in it? Nonsense! They don’t show. Of
course we had to pin it. Seems to me you’re making
a lot of fuss about a simple exchange—I mean
a return. I’d like the money back at once. A credit
check? No, I want the money; I haven’t any with
me, because I depended on getting this. What!
You don’t give back the money? Why, it says in
your advertisements, “Satisfaction given or money
refunded.” Some other shop? Well, I’m sure I
thought it was this shop that did that or I’d never
have bought the stuff here! Rules? Regulations?
Oh, dear! Well, then, take it and give me a credit
check. Yes, I’ll sign my name! Dear me, what a
lot of red tape! I suppose you have to go through
all this to keep from being swindled—Yes, that’s my
name and address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, can I get anything in the store for this
check? Why, that’s rather fun! Seems as if you
were giving it to me for nothing! Oh, how pretty
that chiffon looks as you hold it up to the light! Do
you know, it doesn’t match my satin, but it would
go beautifully with my voile gown, and I want that
made over. I do believe I’d better keep it. It was
a good bargain, I remember. I wonder if it would
match it. I’m sure it would,—I carry colors in my
eye so well,—and it’s a lovely quality. I think, if
you please, I’ll take it back. What, sign my name
again? Well, there, I’ve signed off again. My! it’s
like going to law or a divorce court,—not that I’ve
ever done either, and, after this experience, I hope
I never shall! But just hold that stuff up again.
Oh, now that they’ve turned on the electrics, it’s a
totally different shade! Oh, I don’t want it now
at all! Can’t you turn off the lights again? I’d no
idea it was getting so late!—Oh, well, if you’re going
to be disagreeable, I’ll take it, then. The value
is nothing at all to me! My husband is a prosperous
broker. Yes, I’ll take it. Please send it home for
me, and if I don’t like it when I get it, I’ll send it
back.</p>

<h1 id='ch12'>THE HOUSEWIFE’S HELPER</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,—how do you do? Are you Miss Allfriend?—the
Housewife’s Helper? You must excuse
me, but I never saw a Visiting Housekeeper before,
and I’d no idea they looked so,—so correct! Well,
since you’re here, please begin to housekeep at once.
I’m in such a flurry. You see, I’m standardizing my
housework, and it makes so much confusion. You
understand—don’t you,—all about Lost Motion and
Increased Efficiency? I’m a perfect crank on those
two things. They mean so much to us enlightened
women. Am I a suffragette? Oh, mercy, no! I’m
happily married. But I believe in Ethics and Standardization
and all those modern conveniences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Miss Allfriend, if you’ll please set the dinner
table. I’m having a little dinner to-night for
Senator Caldwell and his wife. They’re terribly
swagger, and, of course, I don’t want to put on any
airs, but I do want things to be nice. So, you set
the table—Where are the things? Why, hunt them
up from the cupboards and buffets? If I get the
things out, I may as well do the work myself! I
thought you were to help! Here’s the center-piece
I want used. Oh,—it is creased, isn’t it? Well,
just press it off. Do it carefully,—there’s so much
in pressing. Well, yes,—it is a little spotted. I
guess you’ll have to wash it. Use only a pure white
soap,—and don’t let the colors run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’d better dust the dishes. Some of them
haven’t been used lately. Of course you know how
to set a table? If you’re uncertain look in the ‘Perfect
Lady’s Home Guide.’ It’s in that drawer, I
think,—or, no,—perhaps it’s upstairs,—or maybe I
loaned it to Miss Jennings,—she’s going to be married
next week, and she has the loveliest—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Allfriend, don’t begin on the table,
now. It’s only three o’clock, and Mrs. Ritchie’s
children are coming to spend the afternoon with
Gladys Gwendolyn. I wish you’d fix up a sort of
little party for them. The Ritchies are new people,
and I want the children to have a good time here.
Can’t you telephone to the caterer for some ices and
cakes? Nothing elaborate,—I think children’s parties
ought to be kept simple. Who is our caterer?
Why,—well,—the truth is, we haven’t one just now,—for
I scolded Lafetti so that I don’t like to call
him again. You see he was rude because we hadn’t
paid—well,—anyway, he was impertinent,—so—don’t
you know of some nice caterer to telephone
to? Order only simple things,—say a Jack Horner
pie, with pretty little gifts in it,—and ices in novel
shapes,—and plenty of bon-bons,—children love
candy so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But before you do that, please just finish off
Gladys Gwendolyn’s little frock. It’s nearly done,
but the seamstress had to leave it to finish my dinner
gown, so you just look after baby’s dress. It
only needs one sleeve set,—and make it a bit larger
round the belt,—it’s too tight for her,—I don’t believe
in cramping the little growing bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m awfully careful with Gladys Gwendolyn. I
boil her toys and I bake her books every day. And
won’t you see,—since you’re here,—that she uses her
germicide spray on the even hours, and her antiseptic
douche every other half hour? It is a help to
have you here, I’m sure. And I wish you would
entertain the kiddies. Not professionally,—you
know,—just tell them stories and make up games
for them. Oh, and be sure to arrange prizes,—children
just love prizes. Are you knacky about such
things? Some people are,—and others are so different!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you play Bridge? I’ve just two tables running
over for a rubber at four, and I’m most sure
one lady won’t come! And you look so,—so,—presentable,
I’d be glad if you’d take a hand, if necessary,—and
I’m pretty certain it will be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I must fly and take my nap. Then I have
to go for my short walk. I have to exercise, or I
gain at once. Now please attend to the things I’ve
asked of you. If you standardize, you can easily
have time for all. And in your spare moments,
here’s a piece of my cross-stitch embroidery,—you
may as well do a little. Be sure to cross the stitches
the way I do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And please answer the telephone when it rings;—oh,
say anything you like. You must have wit
enough to know what to say! If you’re qualified for
a Visiting Helper, you ought to know such things!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And be very careful what you say before Gladys
Gwendolyn. I’m bringing her up in an ethically artistic
atmosphere. I want her to come in contact
only with what is true and beautiful. And unless
I’m ethically pure myself, how can I expect her to
be? So bear that in mind, Miss Allfriend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, and by the way, our telephone is on a party
wire. If you overhear any interesting gossip, be
sure to remember it, and tell me!”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch13'>MRS. LESTER’S HOBBLETTE</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I went to New York yesterday, and, if
you’ll believe me, my dear, I never had such
a day in all my life! You see, I thought I’d shop
a little in the morning, and then meet John for
luncheon, and go to the matinée afterward. Well,
we did all that, but such a time as I had doing it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t go in town with John. He goes on that
eight-thirty-nine—all our best commuters do; but
it’s too early for me to get off. He said we’d lunch
at a swell hotel—John’s a perfect dear about such
things, if we have been married nearly two years.
So, of course, I wanted to look my bestest, and I put
on my new blue gown. I’d never had it on before,
and—Yes, it is a hobble skirt; but I begged Miss
Threadley not to make it extreme. I do hate extreme
fashions. So she said she’d make a modified
hobble, a hobblette, she calls it—and she assured
me it would be all right. It’s a perfect beauty, my
dear; but, good land! It’s exactly the shape of a
bolster slip, and round the knees it’s fitted tightly
and boned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyway, I got into the thing and started
for the ten-forty-eight train. As I started to walk
away I fell over at the very first step! Luckily I
fell into a chair; but I bruised my knee and ankle
dreadfully. Jane brought hot water and witch hazel
and fixed me up, and I started again, for I didn’t
want to lose that train. How I got downstairs I
don’t know. It was a series of jumps and jounces.
But, after this, I shall slide down on a tea tray, as
I used to do when I was a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I knew it was only a matter of learning
to walk in the thing, and I was bound to learn.
I went along the street pretty well as long as I remembered
to take little, tiny steps, but as I reached
Maple Avenue I heard the train coming. You know
there’s a good two blocks to go after that, so I ran!
My dear, if you could have seen me! Talk about
contortionists! Of course my running was just a
sort of jiggety-jig trotting, but I had to keep going
to preserve my equilibrium. I reached the train
just as it was ready to move out of the station. I
tried to step on, but you know how high the lowest
step is. I simply couldn’t reach it. I tried first one
foot and then the other, and neither would come
anywhere near that step without tearing my skirt.
And it wouldn’t tear! If it would, I should have
let it go, for I was filled with mortification. At last
the conductor and the brakeman took me by my elbows
and swung me up or I never should have got
aboard at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then in New York it was dreadful. You know
how I cross the street? I simply have to do it my
own way, for it makes me nervous to depend on
those policemen. I always cross in the middle of a
block to escape them. I just watch for a good
chance, you know, and then I run across fast, and
I always manage all right. But, yesterday, I tried
to run, and that awful skirt held me back, and when
I was about half way across I stumbled in it, and
the trolley cars and motors just clambered all
around me! How I got over alive I don’t know. I
shouldn’t have, only two nice men and a boy seemed
to spring up from somewhere to help me. Well,
then I went on, and I suddenly discovered the lovely
satin hem was getting awfully soiled. So I tried to
hold it up, but—My dear, have you ever tried to
hold up a hobblette? Well, don’t!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s much more unmanageable than a sheath!
I wanted to turn it up, like a man does his trousers
legs, but I felt I was attracting enough attention
as it was. Then, my dear, it was time to go to meet
John, and I tried to get on a street car. Well, the
board of aldermen, or whatever they are, will have
to have those car steps made lower! I had my pay-as-you-go
nickel all ready, but I just couldn’t get up
to the place where you go. And the wretched conductor
wouldn’t help me a bit! He just grinned, as
if it were an old story to him. I tried three or four
cars, but they all had high steps and unhelpful conductors;
so I took a taxicab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do have sense enough to build the steps
of the taxicabs fairly low, so I got in all right and
went straight to the hotel. Well, I had been shopping,
you know, and I had spent much more than I
thought I had—I always do, don’t you?—and, if you
please, I didn’t have money enough in my purse to
pay that cabman! But that isn’t the worst of it!
I did have more money with me, but it was in my
stocking. I always carry some extra bills there, and
I’m rather an adept at getting it out, if need be,
without anyone knowing what I’m doing. But that
skirt wouldn’t budge! I stepped back into the cab
and shut the door, but I simply couldn’t raise that
hobblette enough to get my money. What could I
do? Well, as good luck would have it, John came
along just then, and I opened the cab door as if I
had just arrived. John paid the bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a lovely luncheon—John is a dear man
to go about with—and then we went to a matinée.
But, O, my dear, if my knees didn’t get cramped!
Both feet went to sleep, but they wanted to walk
in their sleep, and they couldn’t. Well, when we did
come out I could scarcely stand, let alone walk!
And John hurried me to the station. And when
we reached the boat it was just beginning to move
from the dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Jump!’ said John. ‘It’s perfectly safe. I’ve got
hold of you. We’ll jump together now.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘I won’t!’ said I firmly, and I didn’t. Why, my
dear, if I had we’d have both gone into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we waited for the next boat, but John didn’t
know why, and never will!”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch14'>AT THE COOKING CLASS</h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, am I late? I’m so sorry! My dear Miss
Cooke, have I kept your class waiting? Now
don’t look at me like that! Cheery and blithe,
please. And Milly,—just wait a minute till I fold
up this veil; they get so rubbishy if you don’t,—truly,
I started early enough, but, you see, I met
Roddy Dow, and—we took a walk around the block,—it’s
such a sunny, shiny, country kind of a day, we
just had to. Of course, I told him I was in a hurry
to get to class, and I babbled on about all the
whipped angel food and eggless omelets we’re going
to learn to make, and he said,—girls, what do you
think he said? He said I was fluffy-minded! Me!
the greatest living example of a young woman with
earnest aims and high ideals! Well,—so I said—yes,
yes, Miss Cooke, I am folding it up as fast as
I can,—I’ll be ready in a minute,—don’t make that
foolish noise, pretty lady. Shall I sit here by Flossy
Fay? Oh, what winsome looking creatures! Live
crabs? Are they? And we’re to learn to make
“Crab Flakes à&nbsp;la Pittsburg?” Oh, how perfectly
gorgeous! Do you know, Flossy, I met that Pittsburg
man last night,—that Mr. Van Roxie. Yes, the
one with one lung and thirty millions. He’s too
ducky for words! He didn’t approve of me at first,—I
sat next to him at dinner, you know,—because
I asked him whether he’d rather talk politics or have
a lover’s quarrel. He looked at me sort of gimletty,—if
you know what I mean,—and he said I was a
Pink and White Mistake! Me! the Only Original
Magazine-Cover Girl! Well—so I said,—yes, Miss
Cooke, I’m listening. Certainly I know what you
said; you said,—well, you said something about
eggs. No, I don’t recall exactly what,—to me,
there’s always an air of mystery about eggs, anyway.
And, besides, most all the recipes are eggless, nowadays,—it’s
the latest fad. Oh, cream the yolks?
Now, isn’t that funny? My new mauve messaline
has a cream yoke,—that heavy lace, you know,—I
think they call it,—My heavens and earth! Miss
Cooke! One of the crabs is loose! Oh, girls, get
up on your chairs! That’s right, Flossy,—climb up
on this table, by me!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O-o-ooh! Police! Turn in an alarm, somebody!
Miss Cooke! Don’t try to pick him up! He’ll attack
you,—and rend you limb from limb!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you step on him! I’m a termagant S. P.
C. A. and I won’t see a poor dumb crab cruelly treated
in my presence! There! He’s run under that
cupboardy thing! You’ll have to poke him out
again!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Flossy, don’t jump about so! This table will
break down; it feels wriggly now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, Miss Cooke, don’t scold me! I can’t help
feeling nervous when that terrifying monster is
walking abroad. Well, I will keep still, but maybe
I won’t resign from this Cooking Class, if we have
to have such frisky viands!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, Miss Cooke, I hate to seem intrusive,—but
there’s another crab flew the coop,—and he’s grabbing
your apron string,—it’s untied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I thought that would make you jump ‘Calm
yourself,’—as you said to me; ‘he won’t hurt you, if
you pick him up properly,’—you said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oo-oo-ee-ee! They’re all out! The whole dozen!
Oh, Miss Cooke, scramble up here, for your life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cissy Gay, if you get up here, too, this table will
break down! Get on the big table; never mind the
eggs. Will you look at those awful beasts! They’re
all over the floor. Oh, I’m so frightened! I wish
Roddy Dow had come in with me! I wish Mr. Willing
was here. I even wish I had that Pittsburg man
to take care of me! Let’s all scream, and maybe the
Janitor will come. Oh, there you are! Please, Janitor,
brush up these crabs somebody spilled, won’t
you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! I never saw a man afraid, before! Get
down off that chair, Dolan! What do you mean?
I’ll report you to the owner of this building! No,
they won’t hurt you! You just pick ’em up by one
hind leg, and they can’t bite. I’d do it myself,—only
I’ve just been manicured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talk about new-fangled housekeeping devices,—what
is most needed is a crab pick-upper. That
would fill a longer felt want than all their fireless
napkins and paper cookers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, they cook now in paper bags. No,
I don’t know much about it, but I’m going to learn.
They say it’s a great time-saver. I suppose they just
take the paper bags of rice or beans or anything, as
they come from the grocer’s, and put them on to
boil. I expect they take the strings off before they
send the bags to the table. It’s largely theoretical, of
course. All these new movements are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m for ’em! This cooking class, now; I
only wish I could have brought Mr. Dow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sitting this way, cross-legged on a kitchen table,
with a frilly, bibby apron on, I know I look exactly
like a Gibsty picture. And it’s all wasted on
you girls!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crabs all corralled? Thank you, Dolan. Now,
Miss Cooke, shall we go on with the lesson?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re sorry, but the time is all used up!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, never mind, Cooksy-Wooksy. I think they
must have been suffragette crabs,—they agitated so
terribly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I don’t mind missing this lesson,—I’ve had
enough deviled crabs for one day!”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h1 id='ch15'>ÆSOP UP TO DATE<br/> THE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL OF MILK</h1>

<p class='pindent'>A milkmaid having been a Good Girl for a
long Time, and Careful in her Work, her
mistress gave her a Pail of New Milk all for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Pail on her Head she tripped Gayly
away to the Market, saying to Herself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How Happy I am! For this Milk I shall get a
Shilling; and with that Shilling I shall buy Twenty
of the Eggs Laid by our Neighbor’s fine Fowls.
These Eggs I shall put under Mistress’s old Hen,
and even if only Half of the Chicks grow up and
Thrive before next Fair time comes Round, I shall
be able to Sell them for a Good Guinea. Then I
shall Buy me a Monte Carlo Coat and an Ermine
Stole, and I will Look so Bewitching that Robin will
Come Up and Offer to be Friends again. But I
won’t make up Too Easily; when he Brings me Violets,
I shall Toss My Head So-and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the Milkmaid gave her Head the Toss she
was thinking about, and the Pail of Milk was Dislodged
from its resting-Place on her Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, being a Member of a Ladies’ Physical Culture
Club, she Deftly Caught the Pail and Replaced
It.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Turned Out as she had planned, and when
Robin married her he gave her an Electric Automobile.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
